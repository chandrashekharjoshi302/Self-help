Finding HTML Elements
When you want to access HTML elements with JavaScript, you have to find the elements first.

There are a couple of ways to do this:

Finding HTML elements by id
Finding HTML elements by tag name
Finding HTML elements by class name
Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors
Finding HTML elements by HTML object collections
Finding HTML Element by Id
The easiest way to find an HTML element in the DOM, is by using the element id.

This example finds the element with id="intro":

Example
var myElement = document.getElementById("intro");
If the element is found, the method will return the element as an object (in myElement).

If the element is not found, myElement will contain null.

Finding HTML Elements by Tag Name
This example finds all <p> elements:

Example
var x = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
This example finds the element with id="main", and then finds all <p> elements inside "main":

Example
var x = document.getElementById("main");
var y = x.getElementsByTagName("p");

Finding HTML Elements by Class Name
If you want to find all HTML elements with the same class name, use getElementsByClassName().
This example returns a list of all elements with class="intro".

Example
var x = document.getElementsByClassName("intro");
Finding elements by class name does not work in Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions.

Finding HTML Elements by CSS Selectors
If you want to find all HTML elements that matches a specified CSS selector (id, class names, types, attributes, values of attributes, etc), use the querySelectorAll() method.
This example returns a list of all <p> elements with class="intro".

Example
var x = document.querySelectorAll("p.intro");
The querySelectorAll() method does not work in Internet Explorer 8 and earlier versions.
