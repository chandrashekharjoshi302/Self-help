Why Use Sass?
Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS pre-processor can help.

Sass lets you use features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports, inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff.

A Simple Example why Sass is Useful
Let's say we have a website with three main colors:

#a2b9bc

#b2ad7f

#878f99

So, how many times do you need to type those HEX values? A LOT of times. And what about variations of the same colors?
