What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

CSS Syntax
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}
Explained
p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).
color is a property, and red is the property value
text-align is a property, and center is the property value

CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

The CSS id Selector
The CSS class Selector
The CSS Universal Selector
The CSS Grouping Selector

All CSS Simple Selectors
Selector	Example	Example description
#id	#firstname	Selects the element with id="firstname"
.class	.intro	Selects all elements with class="intro"
element.class	p.intro	Selects only <p> elements with class="intro"
*	*	Selects all elements
element	p	Selects all <p> elements
element,element,..	div, p	Selects all <div> elements and all <p> elements

CSS Box Model
CSS Box Model
All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.

The CSS Box Model
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins. The image below illustrates the box model:

Explanation of the different parts:

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

CSS Z-index

CSS Layout - The z-index Property
The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.


CSS Overflow
CSS Overflow
The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

The overflow property has the following values:

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

<----->
<----->
CSS Float

The float Property
The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.

The float property can have one of the following values:

left - The element floats to the left of its container
right - The element floats to the right of its container
none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.

CSS Combinators

CSS Combinators
A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.

A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

descendant selector (space)
child selector (>)
adjacent sibling selector (+)
general sibling selector (~)

CSS Pseudo-class

What are Pseudo-classes?
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user mouses over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus

<----->

CSS Pseudo-element

Style HTML Elements With Specific Attributes
It is possible to style HTML elements that have specific attributes or attribute values.

CSS [attribute] Selector
The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.

The following example selects all <a> elements with a target attribute:

Example
a[target] {
  background-color: yellow;
}

CSS Specificity
CSS Specificity
What is Specificity?
If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.

Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declaration is ultimately applied to an element.

Look at the following examples:

<----->
<----->
CSS !important
What is !important?
The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.

In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!

CSS Math Functions
CSS Math Functions
The CSS math functions allow mathematical expressions to be used as property values. Here, we will explain the calc(), max() and min() functions.

The calc() Function
The calc() function performs a calculation to be used as the property value.

The max() Function
The max() function uses the largest value, from a comma-separated list of values, as the property value.

The min() Function
The min() function uses the smallest value, from a comma-separated list of values, as the property value.

What is a Media Query?
Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.

It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

Example
If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background color will be lightblue:

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
